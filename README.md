# PhoenixCrud

This is just a simple example of a small CRUD app using Elixir, Postgres and the [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix).

# Installation

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`
3. Configure [Database Settings](https://github.com/gogogarrett/phoenix_crud/blob/master/lib%2Fphoenix_crud%2Frepo.ex) to use your local postgres enviorment.
4. Run the migrations `mix ecto.migrate Repo`
5. Enjoy.

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

# Goals
- Learn basic elixir.
- Exploring the language and framework to see if it's worth using as a backend for more robust applications.
- Provide more example apps using the [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix).
- Have fun!
